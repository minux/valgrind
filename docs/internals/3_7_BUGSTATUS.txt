Bugs reported after the release of 3.7.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file lists bugs that were reported after 3.7.0 was released, both
in 3.7.0 and trunk, and that have not been closed.  Bugs that have
been closed as "fixed" are listed in the top level NEWS file instead.
In other words they get listed here first and moved to NEWS if they
get fixed.

-- reenable amd64_toIR.c commented out insns
-- amd64 toIR memcheck icc -O3 -mAVX probs?
-- OSX 10.8 (alignment) and XCode 4.3 (build, link) problems

-- add allocator-mismatch checking?
-- 302709, minor tidying needed?
