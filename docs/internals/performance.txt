Notes on performance
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The intent of this file is to record progress in improving performance.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just before 3.1.0:
- Julian made LibVEX_Alloc() inlinable.  Saved a couple of percent.
- Julian started building Vex at -O2.  Saved up to 8% or so(?) in some
  cases.

Post 3.1.0:
- Julian made the tree builder linear.  Saved 2--13% on a range of programs.

COMPVBITS branch:
- Nick converted to compress V bits, initial version saved 0--5% on most
  cases, with a 30% improvement on one case which calls
  set_address_range_perms() a lot.
