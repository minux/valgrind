Cleanups

FXSAVE/FXRSTOR: can no longer say (w.r.t the guest state
effects declaration) that the SSE regs are written/read
in one single block.  Instead need to make a declaration
for each bottom-half independently :-(

in fact, re-check everything that assumes the XMM regs form
an array, because they no longer do.  Done: PCMPISTRI et al,
Also AESENC et al.

* guest state alignment, all targets -- will probably fail now

* FXSAVE/FXRSTOR on amd64, as noted above

* tools other than memcheck -- now fail w/ AVX insns

* remove regclass HRc256

* disable Avx insns in backend (or rm this code, will we
  ever need it?)

* change amd64 getAllocableRegs back to what it was originally
  [DONE]

* fix up none/tests/amd64/avx-1.c
