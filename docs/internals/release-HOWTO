TODO list when doing a Valgrind release (with release number "X.Y.Z")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all:

- Tell valgrind-developers you want to do a release.  Give a timeframe for
  everyone to check in any final features/bug-fixes they want in the
  release.

- Go over the docs, make sure they're up to date.

- Update version number and date in docs/xml/vg-entities.xml.  (Exact
  release date probably won't be known yet, updating it is in the list below
  of tasks for the official release.)

- Write release notes, add to NEWS.  Include a list of fixed bugs from
  Bugzilla.  [[We should decide a defined way of obtaining this list so it's
  consistent and so we don't have to work it out anew each time.]]

- Add X.Y.Z and X.Y.Z.SVN versions to Bugzilla (ask Dirk to do it)


For each release candidate (should do release candidates for big releases,
bug-fix-only releases might not need one):

- Do pre-release testing:
  - Make sure regtests run ok on all platforms of interest.
  - Make sure Mozilla and OpenOffice run ok on all platforms of interest.

- Change release number in AC_INIT() in configure.in to "X.Y.Z-rcN", where
  'N' is the release candidate number.

- Make the tarball ("make dist") and put it on the web somewhere (it doesn't
  have to be on valgrind.org if another site is easier).

- Announce the release:
  - Email valgrind-users and valgrind-developers (but not valgrind-announce).  
  - Make clear it's a release candidate.  
  - Make sure you tell everyone where to download from.
  - Include the release notes in the email (maybe not necessary for release
    candidates 2+).

- Wait 2--3 days for feedback.  If bugs appear:
  - Fix them.
  - Update the bug-fix list in NEWS if necessary.
  - Do another release candidate.


For the official release:

- Again, update date in docs/xml/vg-entities.xml for the official release
  date.

- Do pre-release testing:
  - Make sure regtests run ok on all platforms of interest.
  - Make sure Mozilla and OpenOffice run ok on all platforms of interest.

- Change release number in AC_INIT() in configure.in to "X.Y.Z".

- Tag the repository ("VALGRIND_X_Y_Z").

- Make the tarball ("make dist").
  
- Update website: 
  - Put the tarball up.
  - Update www.valgrind.org/downloads/source_code.html.  
  - Add a news item to the front page and also to valgrind.org/info/news.html.

- Change release number in AC_INIT() in configure.in to "X.Y.Z.SVN", where
  X.Y.Z is one more than the release just done.

- Announce the release:
  - Email valgrind-users, valgrind-developers, and valgrind-announce.  
  - Include the release notes in the email.
