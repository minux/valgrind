Bugs reported after the release of 3.8.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file lists bugs that were reported after 3.8.0 was released, both
in 3.8.0 and trunk, and that have not been closed.  Bugs that have
been closed as "fixed" are listed in the top level NEWS file instead.
In other words they get listed here first and moved to NEWS if they
get fixed.

This file also tracks commits & fixes that should be pushed to the 3.8
branch.

-------- Bugs brought forward from 3_7_BUGSTATUS.txt --------

301281  valgrind hangs on OS X when the process calls system()
  OSX strangeness; **possible 3.8.1
  QUERIED (can't repro)

291310  FXSAVE instruction marks memory as undefined on amd64
  x86 vs amd64 inconsistency?
  **is fixed in 3.8.0, but was not marked as such
  ** no it's not; v38BRANCH shows error, vTRUNK doesn't -- investigate

301280  vex amd64->IR: 0xF 0xB 0x55 0x48 0x89 0xE5 0x41 0x56
  that's UD2; unclear if there is anything to fix here.
301902  vex amd64->IR: 0xF 0xB (UD2)
  == 254088
  **is fixed in 3.8.0, but was not marked as such

298281  wcslen causes false(?) uninitialised value warnings

  REOP: JJ says LZCNT misimplemented

303536  ioctl for SIOCETHTOOL (ethtool(8)) isn't wrapped (w/ patch)
  we should fix this

304346  valgrind::memcheck doesn't seem to work with ptmalloc3
  **fixed in 3.8.0 as a dup of 219156 but was not marked as such

304754  NEWS blows TeX's little mind
  **fixed in 3.8.0 but was not marked as such

-------- Unfixed in 3.8.0

n-i-bz  shmat of a segment > 4Gb does not work
  Fixed r12874
  **3.8.1

303741  sockaddr* parameter of recvfrom not handled correctly
        (corruption not detected later on)
  QUERIED -- need test case, looks easy to fix

303877  valgrind doesn't support compressed debuginfo sections.

304035  disInstr(arm): unhandled instruction 0xE1023053
  UQSUB16 QADD QSUB QDADD SHADD16 UHSUB16
  (but based on 3.6.1; unclear which are still problematic)

304259  support Darwin 12 (Mac OS 10.8, Mountain Lion)
  Canonical OSX 10.8

304321  m_signals.c:2314 (sync_signalhandler_from_kernel): Assertion 'tid != 0' failed
  Probably invalid (way too old)

304450  time logging tools ?
  wishlist

304675  make install-strip fails when cross-compiling
  w/ patch; but needs checking (should be more general?  assumes auto*
  version?)

304676  regtest hangs on mac OS X (mchelp, coolo_sigaction, system)
  probably related to 301281 et al

304744  valgrind hangs on munmap()
  probably invalid

304832  ppc32: build failure
  probably invalid

304867  implement MOVBE instruction in x86 mode
  yeah, need to do this.  ** 3.8.1  Has patch.

304980  Assertion 'lo <= hi' failed in vgModuleLocal_find_rx_mapping (debuginfo.c)
  ****3.8.0 regression; w/ patch but needs testing
  **3.8.1

305042  amd64: implement 0f 7f encoding of movq between two registers
  **3.8.1 possibly

305170  linux: add FIOCLEX and FIONCLEX ioctls
  w/ patch, looks pretty harmless

305199  ARM: implement QDADD and QDSUB
  w/ patch + testcases, looks ready to go (provided V == HW)

n-i-bz  Fixes for more MPI false postives
  **3.8.1
