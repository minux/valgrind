Data-race detection algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- pthread rwlock state tracking and support.
- Eliminate the upper bounds on the number of mutexes, condition variables,
  semaphores, barriers and threads by converting arrays into OSet's.
- Implement segment merging, such that the number of segments per thread
  remains limited even when there is no synchronization between threads.
- Discuss on the Valgrind mailing list how to make it possible to call
  POSIX thread synchronization primitives from client code (drd_intercepts.c)
  without triggering Valgrind's redirection mechanism.
- Find out why a race is reported on std::string::string(std::string const&)
  (stc test case 16).
- Add a regression test for pthread_mutex_timedlock().
- Find a way for suppressing races on _IO_2_1_stdout (this race is triggered
  by calling printf() from more than one thread).
- Performance testing and tuning.
- testing on PPC and AIX (current implementation is only tested on X86 and
  AMD64).
- [AMD64] Find out why removing 'write(1, "", 0)' in drd_intercepts.c triggers
  a crash on AMD64. Is this an exp-drd or a VEX bug ?
- On x86 and amd64 platforms, add support for implicit locking arising from
  the use of the LOCK instruction prefix.


Testing
~~~~~~~
- testing with more complex multithreaded test programs.
- test exp-drd's performance with the SPLASH-2 software, e.g. fft
  (http://www-flash.stanford.edu/apps/SPLASH/).
- Add more Helgrind regression tests to exp-drd's regression test set by adding
  soft links under exp-drd/tests to the respective Helgrind unit tests.


Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Document the command-line options of the exp-drd tool.


Known bugs
~~~~~~~~~~
- Gets killed by the OOM handler for realistically sized applications,
  e.g. knode and OpenOffice.
- When pthread_barrier_wait() is called, some real races are suppressed.
- Does not work with a glibc library compiled with linuxthreads -- NPTL is
  required for proper operation.
- [x86_64] Reports "Allocation context: unknown" for BSS symbols on AMD64
  (works fine on i386). This is a bug in Valgrind's debug info reader
  -- VG_(find_seginfo)() returns NULL for BSS symbols on x86_64. Not yet in
  the KDE bug tracking system.

Known performance issues:
- According to cachegrind, VG_(OSet_Next)() is taking up most CPU cycles.
  Probably due to the bitmap implementation.
