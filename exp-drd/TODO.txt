Data-race detection algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- pthread rwlock state tracking and support.
- Print an error message when memory is freed that contains a locked
  reader-writer synchronization object.
- Print an error message when a semaphore is freed that is being waited upon.
- Eliminate the upper bounds on the number of condition variables,
  semaphores, barriers and threads by converting arrays into OSet's.
- Implement segment merging, such that the number of segments per thread
  remains limited even when there is no synchronization between threads.
- Add locking order checking.
- Make sure tc14_laog_dinphils is run during exp-drd regression tests.
- Discuss on the Valgrind mailing list how to make it possible to call
  POSIX thread synchronization primitives from client code (drd_intercepts.c)
  without triggering Valgrind's redirection mechanism.
- Find out why a race is reported on std::string::string(std::string const&)
  (stc test case 16).
- Add a regression test for pthread_mutex_timedlock().
- Find a way for suppressing races reported on _IO_2_1_stdout. This race is
  triggered by calling printf() from more than one thread. An example:
  ./vg-in-place --tool=exp-drd exp-drd/tests/pth_barrier 2 1
- Add support for objects that are shared over threads and that use reference
  counting, e.g. std::string -- no races should be reported on the reference
  count.
- Performance testing and tuning.
- testing on PPC and AIX (current implementation is only tested on X86 and
  AMD64).
- [AMD64] Find out why removing 'write(1, "", 0)' in drd_intercepts.c triggers
  a crash on AMD64. Is this an exp-drd or a VEX bug ?
- On x86 and amd64 platforms, add support for implicit locking arising from
  the use of the LOCK instruction prefix.


Testing
~~~~~~~
- testing with more complex multithreaded test programs.
- test exp-drd's performance with the SPLASH-2 software, e.g. fft
  (http://www-flash.stanford.edu/apps/SPLASH/).


Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Document the command-line options of the exp-drd tool.
- Explain that happens-before race detectors are also suited for certain
  classes of programs that do not follow a locking discipline
  (e.g. exp-drd/test/matinv.c).


Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~
- Does not work with a glibc library compiled with linuxthreads -- NPTL is
  required for proper operation.


Known bugs
~~~~~~~~~~
- Gets killed by the OOM handler for realistically sized applications,
  e.g. knode and OpenOffice.
- [x86_64] Reports "Allocation context: unknown" for BSS symbols on AMD64
  (works fine on i386). This is a bug in Valgrind's debug info reader
  -- VG_(find_seginfo)() returns NULL for BSS symbols on x86_64. Not yet in
  the KDE bug tracking system.
- tc04_free_lock fails on AMD64 + openSUSE 10.3 (free() locked mutex).

Known performance issues:
- According to cachegrind, VG_(OSet_Next)() is taking up most CPU cycles.
  Probably due to the bitmap implementation.
