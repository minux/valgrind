Data-race detection algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Let DRD print a warning message when, after 30s runtime, the ratio of
  the number of mutex lock / unlock calls to the number of executed basic
  blocks exceeds a certain threshold. Test with Firefox and nautilus.
- Continue discussion about unification of DRD and Helgrind client requests.
- Propose renaming exp-drd back to drd.
- Memory pool support.
- Add locking order checking. Start from the following information:
  * http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=alpine.LNX.1.10.0803270822080.17890%40mudge.stoecker.eu
  * http://lwn.net/Articles/185605/
  * http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=blob;f=Documentation/lockdep-design.txt;h=488773018152056ea159685e732e42452a7ae142;hb=HEAD
- Make sure tc14_laog_dinphils is run during exp-drd regression tests
  (only possible after locking order checking is implemented).
- Find out why no line number or variable name information is printed for
  races detected in parallel sections of OpenMP programs. An example:
  ./vg-in-place --tool=exp-drd exp-drd/tests/omp_prime 4 -t 2
- Find out why 'matinv 400' runs faster in 32-bit mode than in 64-bit mode
  on the same CPU.


Testing
~~~~~~~
- test exp-drd's performance with the SPLASH-2 software, e.g. fft
  (http://www-flash.stanford.edu/apps/SPLASH/) or the PARSEC benchmark
  (http://parsec.cs.princeton.edu/license.htm).
- test with Synfig Studio (see also http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=158555)


Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Document the command-line options of the exp-drd tool.
- Explain that happens-before race detectors are also suited for certain
  classes of programs that do not follow a locking discipline
  (e.g. exp-drd/test/matinv.c).
- Add a note about how much stack is needed for exp-drd itself.
- Explain how to handle transactions (with regard to locking order).
- Continue the discussion on the Valgrind mailing list about docbook and
  'make dist'. See also http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162121.


Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~
- Does not work with a glibc library compiled with linuxthreads -- NPTL is
  required for proper operation.
- openSUSE 10.3, ppc: unless the glibc debuginfo packages is installed,
  false positives are reported on ld.so.
