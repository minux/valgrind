The following failure _might_ be caused by linking to NVidia's
   libGL.so, so avoiding it, if you can, _might_ help you.  For example,
   re-build any Qt libraries you are using without OpenGL support.

Valgrind detected that your program requires
the following unimplemented functionality:
   modify_ldt(): I (JRS) haven't investigated this yet; sorry.
This may be because the functionality is hard to implement,
or because no reasonable program would behave this way,
or because nobody has yet needed it.  In any case, let me know
(jseward@acm.org) and/or try to work around the problem, if you can.

Valgrind has to exit now.  Sorry.  Bye!
