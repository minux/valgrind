Release notes for Valgrind, version 1.0.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
> We're well past 1.0.0.  I propose removing the version number here;
> it doesn't contribute anything, and just gets out-of-date.

KDE3 developers: please read also README_KDE3_FOLKS for guidance
about how to debug KDE3 applications with Valgrind.

> I propose removing README_KDE3_FOLKS, and this reference to it;  I
> think Valgrind has been around long enough that KDE developers don't
> need separate instructions.

[snip]

Valgrind works best on systems with glibc-2.1.X or 2.2.X, and with gcc
versions prior to 3.1.  gcc-3.1 works, but generates code which causes
valgrind to report many false errors.  For now, try to use a gcc prior
to 3.1; if you can't, at least compile your application without
optimisation.  Valgrind-1.0.X also can't handle glibc-2.3.X systems.

> Out of date:  I think glibc-2.3.X is ok, right?  Also gcc-3.1 is ok?

Executive Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

> This summary doesn't account for the core/tool split.  Should be
> similar to the overview on the website.

[snip]

Valgrind is closely tied to details of the CPU, operating system and
to a less extent, compiler and basic C libraries. This makes it
difficult to make it portable, so I have chosen at the outset to
concentrate on what I believe to be a widely used platform: Red Hat
Linux 7.2, on x86s. I believe that it will work without significant
difficulty on other x86 GNU/Linux systems which use the 2.4 kernel and
GNU libc 2.2.X, for example SuSE 7.1 and Mandrake 8.0.  This version
1.0 release is known to work on Red Hats 6.2, 7.2 and 7.3, at the very
least.

> Out of date... could make more generic, eg. works on most/all common
> Linux distros
