<h2>1&nbsp; Introduction</h2>

<a name="supexec"></a>
<h3>1.1&nbsp; Supervised Execution</h3>

Valgrind provides a generic infrastructure for supervising the execution of
programs.  This is done by providing a way to instrument programs in very
precise ways, making it relatively easy to support activities such as dynamic
error detection and profiling.<p>

Although writing a skin is not easy, and requires learning quite a few things
about Valgrind, it is much easier than instrumenting a program from scratch
yourself.

<a name="skins"></a>
<h3>1.2&nbsp; Skins</h3>
The key idea behind Valgrind's architecture is the division between its
``core'' and ``skins''.
<p>
The core provides the common low-level infrastructure to support program
instrumentation, including the x86-to-x86 JIT compiler, low-level memory
manager, signal handling and a scheduler (for pthreads).   It also provides
certain services that are useful to some but not all skins, such as support
for error recording and suppression.
<p>
But the core leaves certain operations undefined, which must be filled by skins.
Most notably, skins define how program code should be instrumented.  They can
also define certain variables to indicate to the core that they would like to
use certain services, or be notified when certain interesting events occur.
<p>
Each skin that is written defines a new program supervision tool.  Writing a
new tool just requires writing a new skin.  The core takes care of all the hard
work.
<p>

<a name="execspaces"></a>
<h3>1.3&nbsp; Execution Spaces</h3>
An important concept to understand before writing a skin is that there are
three spaces in which program code executes:

<ol>
  <li>User space: this covers most of the program's execution.  The skin is
      given the code and can instrument it any way it likes, providing (more or
      less) total control over the code.<p>

      Code executed in user space includes all the program code, almost all of
      the C library (including things like the dynamic linker), and almost
      all parts of all other libraries.
  </li><p>

  <li>Core space: a small proportion of the program's execution takes place
      entirely within Valgrind's core.  This includes:<p>

      <ul>
        <li>Dynamic memory management (<code>malloc()</code> etc.)</li>

        <li>Pthread operations and scheduling</li>

        <li>Signal handling</li>
      </ul><p>

      A skin has no control over these operations;  it never ``sees'' the code
      doing this work and thus cannot instrument it.  However, the core
      provides hooks so a skin can be notified when certain interesting events
      happen, for example when when dynamic memory is allocated or freed, the
      stack pointer is changed, or a pthread mutex is locked, etc.<p>

      Note that these hooks only notify skins of events relevant to user 
      space.  For example, when the core allocates some memory for its own use,
      the skin is not notified of this, because it's not directly part of the
      supervised program's execution.
  </li><p>
      
  <li>Kernel space: execution in the kernel.  Two kinds:<p>
   
      <ol>
        <li>System calls:  can't be directly observed by either the skin or the
            core.  But the core does have some idea of what happens to the
            arguments, and it provides hooks for a skin to wrap system calls.
        </li><p>

        <li>Other: all other kernel activity (e.g. process scheduling) is
            totally opaque and irrelevant to the program.
        </li><p>
      </ol>
  </li><p>

  It should be noted that a skin only has direct control over code executed in
  user space.  This is the vast majority of code executed, but it is not
  absolutely all of it, so any profiling information recorded by a skin won't
  be totally accurate.
</ol>


<a name="writingaskin"></a>
<h2>2&nbsp; Writing a Skin</h2>

<a name="whywriteaskin"</a>
<h3>2.1&nbsp; Why write a skin?</h3>

Before you write a skin, you should have some idea of what it should do.  What
is it you want to know about your programs of interest?  Consider some existing
skins:

<ul>
  <li>memcheck: among other things, performs fine-grained validity and
      addressibility checks of every memory reference performed by the program
      </li><p>

  <li>addrcheck: performs lighterweight addressibility checks of every memory
      reference performed by the program</li><p>

  <li>cachegrind: tracks every instruction and memory reference to simulate
      instruction and data caches, tracking cache accesses and misses that
      occur on every line in the program</li><p>

  <li>helgrind: tracks every memory access and mutex lock/unlock to determine
      if a program contains any data races</li><p>

  <li>lackey: does simple counting of various things: the number of calls to a
      particular function (<code>_dl_runtime_resolve()</code>);  the number of
      basic blocks, x86 instruction, UCode instructions executed;  the number
      of branches executed and the proportion of those which were taken.</li><p>
</ul>

These examples give a reasonable idea of what kinds of things Valgrind can be
used for.  The instrumentation can range from very lightweight (e.g. counting
the number of times a particular function is called) to very intrusive (e.g.
memcheck's memory checking).

<a name="howskinswork"</a>
<h3>2.2&nbsp; How skins work</h3>

Skins must define various functions for instrumenting programs that are called
by Valgrind's core, yet they must be implemented in such a way that they can be
written and compiled without touching Valgrind's core.  This is important,
because one of our aims is to allow people to write and distribute their own
skins that can be plugged into Valgrind's core easily.<p>

This is achieved by packaging each skin into a separate shared object which is
then loaded ahead of the core shared object <code>valgrind.so</code>, using the
dynamic linker's <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> variable.  Any functions defined in
the skin that share the name with a function defined in core (such as
the instrumentation function <code>SK_(instrument)()</code>) override the
core's definition.  Thus the core can call the necessary skin functions.<p>

This magic is all done for you;  the shared object used is chosen with the
<code>--skin</code> option to the <code>valgrind</code> startup script.  The
default skin used is <code>memcheck</code>, Valgrind's original memory checker.

<a name="gettingcode"</a>
<h3>2.3&nbsp; Getting the code</h3>

To write your own skin, you'll need to check out a copy of Valgrind from the
CVS repository, rather than using a packaged distribution.  This is because it
contains several extra files needed for writing skins.<p>

To check out the code from the CVS repository, first login:
<blockquote><code>
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.valgrind.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/valgrind login
</code></blockquote>

Then checkout the code.  To get a copy of the current development version
(recommended for the brave only):
<blockquote><code>
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.valgrind.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/valgrind co valgrind
</code></blockquote>

To get a copy of the stable released branch:
<blockquote><code>
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.valgrind.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/valgrind co -r <i>TAG</i> valgrind
</code></blockquote>

where <code><i>TAG</i></code> has the form <code>VALGRIND_X_Y_Z</code> for
version X.Y.Z.

<a name="gettingstarted"</a>
<h3>2.4&nbsp; Getting started</h3>

Valgrind uses GNU <code>automake</code> and <code>autoconf</code> for the
creation of Makefiles and configuration.  But don't worry, these instructions
should be enough to get you started even if you know nothing about those
tools.<p>

In what follows, all filenames are relative to Valgrind's top-level directory
<code>valgrind/</code>.

<ol>
  <li>Choose a name for the skin, and an abbreviation that can be used as a
      short prefix.  We'll use <code>foobar</code> and <code>fb</code> as an
      example.
  </li><p>

  <li>Make a new directory <code>foobar/</code> which will hold the skin.
  </li><p>

  <li>Copy <code>example/Makefile.am</code> into <code>foobar/</code>.
      Edit it by replacing all occurrences of the string
      ``<code>example</code>'' with ``<code>foobar</code>'' and the one
      occurrence of the string ``<code>ex_</code>'' with ``<code>fb_</code>''.
      It might be worth trying to understand this file, at least a little;  you
      might have to do more complicated things with it later on.  In
      particular, the name of the <code>vgskin_foobar_so_SOURCES</code> variable
      determines the name of the skin's shared object, which determines what
      name must be passed to the <code>--skin</code> option to use the skin.
  </li><p>

  <li>Copy <code>example/ex_main.c</code> into
      <code>foobar/</code>, renaming it as <code>fb_main.c</code>.
      Edit it by changing the five lines in <code>SK_(pre_clo_init)()</code>
      to something appropriate for the skin.  These fields are used in the
      startup message, except for <code>bug_reports_to</code> which is used
      if a skin assertion fails.
  </li><p>

  <li>Edit <code>Makefile.am</code>, adding the new directory
      <code>foobar</code> to the <code>SUBDIRS</code> variable.
  </li><p>

  <li>Edit <code>configure.in</code>, adding <code>foobar/Makefile</code> to the
      <code>AC_OUTPUT</code> list.
  </li><p>

  <li>Run:
      <pre>
    autogen.sh
    ./configure --prefix=`pwd`/inst
    make install</pre>

      It should automake, configure and compile without errors, putting copies
      of the skin's shared object <code>vgskin_foobar.so</code> in
      <code>foobar/</code> and
      <code>inst/lib/valgrind/</code>.
  </li><p>

  <li>You can test it with a command like
      <pre>
    inst/bin/valgrind --skin=foobar date</pre>

      (almost any program should work; <code>date</code> is just an example).  
      The output should be something like this:
      <pre>
==738== foobar-0.0.1, a foobarring tool for x86-linux.
==738== Copyright (C) 2002, and GNU GPL'd, by J. Random Hacker.
==738== Built with valgrind-1.1.0, a program execution monitor.
==738== Copyright (C) 2000-2002, and GNU GPL'd, by Julian Seward.
==738== Estimated CPU clock rate is 1400 MHz
==738== For more details, rerun with: -v
==738== 
Wed Sep 25 10:31:54 BST 2002
==738==</pre>

      The skin does nothing except run the program uninstrumented.
  </li><p>
</ol>

These steps don't have to be followed exactly - you can choose different names
for your source files, and use a different <code>--prefix</code> for
<code>./configure</code>.<p>

Now that we've setup, built and tested the simplest possible skin, onto the
interesting stuff...


<a name="writingcode"></a>
<h3>2.5&nbsp; Writing the code</h3>

A skin must define at least these four functions:
<pre>
    SK_(pre_clo_init)()
    SK_(post_clo_init)()
    SK_(instrument)()
    SK_(fini)()
</pre>

Also, it must use the macro <code>VG_DETERMINE_INTERFACE_VERSION</code>
exactly once in its source code.  If it doesn't, you will get a link error
involving <code>VG_(skin_interface_major_version)</code>.  This macro is
used to ensure the core/skin interface used by the core and a plugged-in
skin are binary compatible.

In addition, if a skin wants to use some of the optional services provided by
the core, it may have to define other functions.

<a name="init"></a>
<h3>2.6&nbsp; Initialisation</h3>

Most of the initialisation should be done in <code>SK_(pre_clo_init)()</code>.
Only use <code>SK_(post_clo_init)()</code> if a skin provides command line
options and must do some initialisation after option processing takes place
(``<code>clo</code>'' stands for ``command line options'').<p>

First of all, various ``details'' need to be set for a skin, using the
functions <code>VG_(details_*)()</code>.  These are all compulsory except for
<code>version</code>.  They are used when constructing the startup message,
except for <code></code> which is used if <code>VG_(skin_panic)()</code> is
ever called, or a skin assertion fails.<p>

Second, various ``needs'' can be set for a skin, using the functions
<code>VG_(needs_*)()</code>.  They are mostly booleans, and can be left
untouched (they default to <code>False</code>).  They determine whether a skin
can do various things such as:  record, report and suppress errors; process
command line options;  wrap system calls;  record extra information about
malloc'd blocks, etc.<p>

For example, if a skin wants the core's help in recording and reporting errors,
it must set the <code>skin_errors</code> need to <code>True</code>, and then
provide definitions of six functions for comparing errors, printing out errors,
reading suppressions from a suppressions file, etc.  While writing these
functions requires some work, it's much less than doing error handling from
scratch because the core is doing most of the work.  See the type
<code>VgNeeds</code> in <code>include/vg_skin.h</code> for full details of all
the needs.<p>

Third, the skin can indicate which events in core it wants to be notified
about, using the functions <code>VG_(track_*)()</code>.  These include things
such as blocks of memory being malloc'd, the stack pointer changing, a mutex
being locked, etc.  If a skin wants to know about this, it should set the
relevant pointer in the structure to point to a function, which will be called
when that event happens.<p>

For example, if the skin want to be notified when a new block of memory is
malloc'd, it should call <code>VG_(track_new_mem_heap)()</code> with an
appropriate function pointer, and the assigned function will be called each
time this happens.<p>

More information about ``details'', ``needs'' and ``trackable events'' can be
found in <code>include/vg_skin.h</code>.<p>

<a name="instr"></a>
<h3>2.7&nbsp; Instrumentation</h3>

<code>SK_(instrument)()</code> is the interesting one.  It allows you to
instrument <i>UCode</i>, which is Valgrind's RISC-like intermediate language.
UCode is described in the <a href="techdocs.html">technical docs</a>.

The easiest way to instrument UCode is to insert calls to C functions when
interesting things happen.  See the skin ``lackey''
(<code>lackey/lk_main.c</code>) for a simple example of this, or
Cachegrind (<code>cachegrind/cg_main.c</code>) for a more complex
example.<p>

A much more complicated way to instrument UCode, albeit one that might result
in faster instrumented programs, is to extend UCode with new UCode
instructions.  This is recommended for advanced Valgrind hackers only!  See the
``memcheck'' skin for an example.

<a name="fini"></a>
<h3>2.8&nbsp; Finalisation</h3>

This is where you can present the final results, such as a summary of the
information collected.  Any log files should be written out at this point.

<a name="otherimportantinfo"></a>
<h3>2.9&nbsp; Other important information</h3>

Please note that the core/skin split infrastructure is all very new, and not
very well documented.  Here are some important points, but there are
undoubtedly many others that I should note but haven't thought of.<p>

The file <code>include/vg_skin.h</code> contains all the types,
macros, functions, etc. that a skin should (hopefully) need, and is the only
<code>.h</code> file a skin should need to <code>#include</code>.<p>

In particular, you probably shouldn't use anything from the C library (there
are deep reasons for this, trust us).  Valgrind provides an implementation of a
reasonable subset of the C library, details of which are in
<code>vg_skin.h</code>.<p>

Similarly, when writing a skin, you shouldn't need to look at any of the code
in Valgrind's core.  Although it might be useful sometimes to help understand
something.<p>

<code>vg_skin.h</code> has a reasonable amount of documentation in it that
should hopefully be enough to get you going.  But ultimately, the skins
distributed (memcheck, addrcheck, cachegrind, lackey, etc.) are probably the
best documentation of all, for the moment.<p>

Note that the <code>VG_</code> and <code>SK_</code> macros are used heavily.
These just prepend longer strings in front of names to avoid potential
namespace clashes.  We strongly recommend using the <code>SK_</code> macro
for any global functions and variables in your skin.<p>

<a name="wordsofadvice"</a>
<h3>2.10&nbsp; Words of Advice</h3>

Writing and debugging skins is not trivial.  Here are some suggestions for
solving common problems.<p>

If you are getting segmentation faults in C functions used by your skin, the
usual GDB command:
<blockquote><code>gdb <i>prog</i> core</code></blockquote>
usually gives the location of the segmentation fault.<p>

If you want to debug C functions used by your skin, you can attach GDB to
Valgrind with some effort:
<ul>
  <li>Enable the following code in <code>coregrind/vg_main.c</code> by
  changing <code>if (0)</code> into <code>if (1)</code>:
<pre>
   /* Hook to delay things long enough so we can get the pid and
      attach GDB in another shell. */
   if (0) { 
      Int p, q;
      for (p = 0; p < 50000; p++)
         for (q = 0; q < 50000; q++) ;
   }
      </li><p>
      and rebuild Valgrind.

  <li>Then run: 
      <blockquote><code>valgrind <i>prog</i></code></blockquote>

      Valgrind starts the program, printing its process id, and then delays for
      a few seconds (you may have to change the loop bounds to get a suitable
      delay).</li><p>
      
  <li>In a second shell run: 
  
      <blockquote><code>gdb <i>prog</i> <i>pid</i></code></blockquote></li><p>
</ul>

GDB may be able to give you useful information.  Note that by default
most of the system is built with <code>-fomit-frame-pointer</code>,
and you'll need to get rid of this to extract useful tracebacks from
GDB.<p>

If you just want to know whether a program point has been reached, using the
<code>OINK</code> macro (in <code> include/vg_skin.h</code>) can be easier than
using GDB.<p>

If you are having problems with your UCode instrumentation, it's likely that
GDB won't be able to help at all.  In this case, Valgrind's
<code>--trace-codegen</code> option is invaluable for observing the results of
instrumentation.<p>

The other debugging command line options can be useful too (run <code>valgrind
-h</code> for the list).<p>

<a name="advancedtopics"></a>
<h2>3&nbsp; Advanced Topics</h2>

Once a skin becomes more complicated, there are some extra things you may
want/need to do.

<a name="suppressions"</a>
<h3>3.1&nbsp; Suppressions</h3>

If your skin reports errors and you want to suppress some common ones, you can
add suppressions to the suppression files.  The relevant files are 
<code>valgrind/*.supp</code>;  the final suppression file is aggregated from
these files by combining the relevant <code>.supp</code> files depending on the
versions of linux, X and glibc on a system.

<a name="documentation"</a>
<h3>3.2&nbsp; Documentation</h3>

If you are feeling conscientious and want to write some HTML documentation for
your skin, follow these steps (using <code>foobar</code> as the example skin
name again):

<ol>
  <li>Make a directory <code>foobar/docs/</code>.
  </li><p>

  <li>Edit <code>foobar/Makefile.am</code>, adding <code>docs</code> to
      the <code>SUBDIRS</code> variable.
  </li><p>

  <li>Edit <code>configure.in</code>, adding
      <code>foobar/docs/Makefile</code> to the <code>AC_OUTPUT</code> list.
  </li><p>

  <li>Write <code>foobar/docs/Makefile.am</code>.  Use
      <code>memcheck/docs/Makefile.am</code> as an example.
  </li>

  <li>Write the documentation;  the top-level file should be called
      <code>foobar/docs/index.html</code>.
  </li><p>

  <li>(optional) Add a link in the main documentation index
      <code>docs/index.html</code> to
      <code>foobar/docs/index.html</code>
  </li><p>
</ol>

<a name="regressiontests"</a>
<h3>3.3&nbsp; Regression tests</h3>

Valgrind has some support for regression tests.  If you want to write
regression tests for your skin:

<ol>
  <li>Make a directory <code>foobar/tests/</code>.
  </li><p>

  <li>Edit <code>foobar/Makefile.am</code>, adding <code>tests</code> to
      the <code>SUBDIRS</code> variable.
  </li><p>

  <li>Edit <code>configure.in</code>, adding
      <code>foobar/tests/Makefile</code> to the <code>AC_OUTPUT</code> list.
  </li><p>

  <li>Write <code>foobar/tests/Makefile.am</code>.  Use
      <code>memcheck/tests/Makefile.am</code> as an example.
  </li><p>

  <li>Write the tests, <code>.vgtest</code> test description files, 
      <code>.stdout.exp</code> and <code>.stderr.exp</code> expected output
      files.  (Note that Valgrind's output goes to stderr.)  Some details
      on writing and running tests are given in the comments at the top of the
      testing script <code>tests/vg_regtest</code>.
  </li><p>

  <li>Write a filter for stderr results <code>foobar/tests/filter_stderr</code>.
      It can call the existing filters in <code>tests/</code>.  See
      <code>memcheck/tests/filter_stderr</code> for an example;  in particular
      note the <code>$dir</code> trick that ensures the filter works correctly
      from any directory.
  </li><p>
</ol>

<a name="profiling"</a>
<h3>3.4&nbsp; Profiling</h3>

To do simple tick-based profiling of a skin, include the line 
<blockquote>
#include "vg_profile.c"
</blockquote>
in the skin somewhere, and rebuild (you may have to <code>make clean</code>
first).  Then run Valgrind with the <code>--profile=yes</code> option.<p>

The profiler is stack-based;  you can register a profiling event with
<code>VGP_(register_profile_event)()</code> and then use the
<code>VGP_PUSHCC</code> and <code>VGP_POPCC</code> macros to record time spent
doing certain things.  New profiling event numbers must not overlap with the
core profiling event numbers.  See <code>include/vg_skin.h</code> for details
and the ``memcheck'' skin for an example.


<a name="othermakefilehackery"</a>
<h3>3.5&nbsp; Other makefile hackery</h3>

If you add any directories under <code>valgrind/foobar/</code>, you will
need to add an appropriate <code>Makefile.am</code> to it, and add a
corresponding entry to the <code>AC_OUTPUT</code> list in
<code>valgrind/configure.in</code>.<p>

If you add any scripts to your skin (see Cachegrind for an example) you need to
add them to the <code>bin_SCRIPTS</code> variable in
<code>valgrind/foobar/Makefile.am</code>.<p>

<h3>3.5&nbsp; Core/skin interface versions</h3>

In order to allow for the core/skin interface to evolve over time, Valgrind
uses a basic interface versioning system.  All a skin has to do is use the
<code>VG_DETERMINE_INTERFACE_VERSION</code> macro exactly once in its code.
If not, a link error will occur when the skin is built.
<p>
The interface version number has the form X.Y.  Changes in Y indicate binary
compatible changes.  Changes in X indicate binary incompatible changes.  If
the core and skin has the same major version number X they should work
together.  If X doesn't match, Valgrind will abort execution with an
explanation of the problem.
<p>
This approach was chosen so that if the interface changes in the future,
old skins won't work and the reason will be clearly explained, instead of
possibly crashing mysteriously.  We have attempted to minimise the potential
for binary incompatible changes by means such as minimising the use of naked
structs in the interface.

<h2>4&nbsp; Final Words</h2>

This whole core/skin business is very new and experimental, and under active
development.<p>

The first consequence of this is that the core/skin interface is quite
immature.  It will almost certainly change in the future;  we have no intention
of freezing it and then regretting the inevitable stupidities.  Hopefully most
of the future changes will be to add new features, hooks, functions, etc,
rather than to change old ones, which should cause a minimum of trouble for
existing skins, and we've put some effort into future-proofing the interface
to avoid binary incompatibility.  But we can't guarantee anything.  The
versioning system should catch any incompatibilities.  Just something to be
aware of.<p>

The second consequence of this is that we'd love to hear your feedback about
it:

<ul>
  <li>If you love it or hate it</li><p>
  <li>If you find bugs</li><p>
  <li>If you write a skin</li><p>
  <li>If you have suggestions for new features, needs, trackable events,
      functions</li><p>
  <li>If you have suggestions for making skins easier to write</li><p>
  <li>If you have suggestions for improving this documentation</li><p>
  <li>If you don't understand something</li><p>
</ul>

or anything else!<p>

Happy programming.
