/*
   The stack
   ~~~~~~~~~
   The stack's segment seems to be dynamically extended downwards
   by the kernel as the stack pointer moves down.  Initially, a
   1-page (4k) stack is allocated.  When %esp moves below that for
   the first time, presumably a page fault occurs.  The kernel
   detects that the faulting address is in the range from %esp upwards
   to the current valid stack.  It then extends the stack segment
   downwards for enough to cover the faulting address, and resumes
   the process (invisibly).  The process is unaware of any of this.

   That means that Valgrind can't spot when the stack segment is
   being extended.  Fortunately, we want to precisely and continuously
   update stack permissions around %esp, so we need to spot all
   writes to %esp anyway.

   The deal is: when %esp is assigned a lower value, the stack is
   being extended.  Create a secondary maps to fill in any holes
   between the old stack ptr and this one, if necessary.  Then 
   mark all bytes in the area just "uncovered" by this %esp change
   as write-only.

   When %esp goes back up, mark the area receded over as unreadable
   and unwritable.

   Just to record the %esp boundary conditions somewhere convenient:
   %esp always points to the lowest live byte in the stack.  All
   addresses below %esp are not live; those at and above it are.
