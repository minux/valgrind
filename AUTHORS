Julian Seward, jseward@acm.org, was the original author, creating the
dynamic translation framework, memcheck stuff, and the
signal/syscall/threads support gunk.

Nicholas Nethercote, njn25@cam.ac.uk, did the core/tool
generalisation, and wrote Cachegrind and some of the other tools, and
tons of other stuff, including code generation improvments.

Jeremy Fitzhardinge, jeremy@goop.org, wrote Helgrind, and lots of
syscall/signal simulation stuff, including a complete redesign of how
syscalls and signals are handled.  Also code generation improvements.

Tom Hughes, thh@cyberscience.com, did a vast number of bug fixes, and
helped out with support for more recent Linux/glibc versions".

Robert Walsh, rjwalsh@durables.org, added file descriptor leakage
checking, new library interception machinery, support for client
allocation pools, and minor other tweakage.

readelf's dwarf2 source line reader, written by Nick Clifton, was
modified to be used in Valgrind by Daniel Berlin.

Michael Matz and Simon Hausmann modified the GNU binutils
demangler(s) for use in Valgrind.

Dirk Mueller contrib'd the malloc-free mismatch checking stuff,
and other bits and pieces.

Lots of other people sent bug reports, patches, and very 
helpful feedback.  I thank you all.
