Julian Seward, jseward@acm.org, is the main author.

Nicholas Nethercote, njn25@cam.ac.uk, did the core/tool
generalisation, and wrote Cachegrind and some of the other tools.

Jeremy Fitzhardinge, jeremy@goop.org, wrote much of Helgrind, and lots
of low-level syscall/signal stuff.

readelf's dwarf2 source line reader, written by Nick Clifton, was
modified to be used in Valgrind by Daniel Berlin.

Michael Matz and Simon Hausmann modified the GNU binutils
demangler(s) for use in Valgrind.

Dirk Mueller contrib'd the malloc-free mismatch checking stuff,
and other bits and pieces.

Lots of other people sent bug reports, patches, and very 
helpful feedback.  I thank you all.
