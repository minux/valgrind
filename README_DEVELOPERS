Building and not installing it
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To run Valgrind without having to install it, run coregrind/valgrind (prefix
with "sh" because it's not executable) with the --in-place=<dir> option, where
<dir> is the root of the source tree (and must be an absolute path).  Eg:

  sh ~/grind/head4/coregrind/valgrind --in-place=/homes/njn25/grind/head4

This allows you to compile and run with "make" instead of "make install",
saving you time.

I recommend compiling with "make --quiet" to further reduce the amount of
output spewed out during compilation, letting you actually see any errors,
warnings, etc.


Running the regression tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To build and run all the regression tests, run "make [--quiet] regtest".

To run a subset of the regression tests, execute:

  perl tests/vg_regtest <name>

where <name> is a directory (all tests within will be run) or a single
.vgtest test file, or the name of a program which has a like-named .vgtest
file.  Eg:

  perl tests/vg_regtest memcheck
  perl tests/vg_regtest memcheck/tests/badfree.vgtest
  perl tests/vg_regtest memcheck/tests/badfree
